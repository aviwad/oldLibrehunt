# LibreHunt (notice, deprecated, use the newer JS client side version)

My MYP personal project, a website to aid you on your libre/distro hunt!

# Use

Available on <a>https://www.librehunt.org</a>

# Features

A website aimed at all (potential) Linux users! Helps everyone choose a Distro. It's also perfect to explain and convince anyone to choose Linux!
Underneath the hood, it uses...
* SQLite3 for the database of distros and their properties (46 distros currently!)
* Flask for the server
* Python for the backend logic / language
* Bootstrap, with some of my customizations (such as purple and fluid buttons)
* Twitter's Twemojis for the neat icons and emoji font

# Install

To work on this / clone this / use this, install Flask (a `pip install` away)

# Similar Projects

It is quite similar to DistroChooser (<a>https://www.distrochooser.de/en</a>)
